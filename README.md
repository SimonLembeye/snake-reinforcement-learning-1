# Learn to play Snake using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

The concept is as follows: the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, 
with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The line resembles a moving 
snake that becomes longer as it eats food. The player loses when the snake runs 
into the screen border or itself. The goal is to get as long as possible before 
dying. In this report, we introduce our different reinforcement learning 
approaches in order to efficiently train an agent to play Snake.
